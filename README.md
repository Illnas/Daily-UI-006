Daily UI Challenge 006 

Challenge now was to create user profile. After searching for examples of user profiles, I got an idea.
What about making a database full of profiles? Like, I am making things about Animal Kingdom, so why not have
profiles on Animals? I just hope I did create what was expected in this challenge. 

On second thought, this would be awesome to further code later on when I start using React. 

Well, see ya in next challenge!
